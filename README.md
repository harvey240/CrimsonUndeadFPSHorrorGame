This repository contains the open source code for my FPS horror game, "crimson undead" which can be freely used for future games research.

Also attached is my final research paper which describes in more detail what the project entailed and discovered.

For this project I investigated game displays and their differing 
effects on player experience, immersion, stress, and performance, 
specifically within the horror genre. I built and developed an FPS 
Horror game, Crimson Undead , from the ground up using Unity, 
allowing me to make creative design decisions for an authentic 
and atmospheric horror experience. I designed and implemented 
several different health and ammunition displays that varied in 
their types and information visualisation techniques. I conducted a 
user study to investigate the different displays and gather 
appropriate metrics. Contributing to games user research, I wrote 
a full research paper presenting the process and results
